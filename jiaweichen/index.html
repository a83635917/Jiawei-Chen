    <h1>Title of the Story</h1>
    <h2>By Jiawei. chen</h2>
    <p>Christmas in China and America is totally different. And my Christmas has been changed since I came here.
In China, only places like squares and shopping malls are decorated for Christmas.
In America, everybody will decorate their house, you will see the lights whole street.They value Christmas as much as New Year.
My Christmas in China.
Played online games with friends, sometimes we will go to shopping or go to food court.
My Christmas in the United States. 
First year here, I had no friends and My family only treats Christmas as an ordinary holiday, and there is no celebration. 
The second years, I had some friends already, we hang out, shoping, eat, and Look at the scenery.
The third years, I rented an apartment by myself, I decorated it with my friends and made food by ourselves. 
This year, I got my car, I plain to drive around NY and do something interesting with my friends.</p>
